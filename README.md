## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this React project, I learned how to use SCSS for improved styling and maintainability. I installed node-sass, imported SCSS files, and organized them into partials. SCSS variables were particularly useful for absolute positioning and flexbox, while mixins helped with form validation.

Additionally, the project included basic form validation using regular expressions (regex). Regex patterns were used to validate email and password inputs, ensuring that user input was valid before submitting it to a database or API. These features helped to improve the overall user experience of the React project.
